          Rose is an LSP-based Semantic Extraction tool being developed by Karoo Compute Solutions to support the rapid translation of software from one language to another.
        </p>
        <p>
          Through the use of Semantic Extraction, Rose can check the equivalence of two codebases, providing useful diagnostic information for any discrepancies.
          This is to be used in conjunction with an LLM to automate the translation process.
        </p>
        <p>
          Rose is still under development, and not publicly available yet.
